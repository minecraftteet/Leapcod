The `smallestSufficientTeam` function finds a sufficient team of the smallest possible size based on the given `req_skills` and `people`.

1. First, the function creates a dictionary `skill_to_index`, mapping each skill in `req_skills` to its index in the list. This is done to efficiently convert people's skills into bitmasks.

2. The function calculates the number of required skills `n` and creates a bitmask `target` that represents all required skills. Each bit of `target` corresponds to one skill, and all bits are set to 1, indicating that all skills are required.

3. The `people_bitmasks` list is created by converting each person's skills into a bitmask. Each bitmask represents the skills that a person possesses. For example, if a person has skills ["java", "nodejs"], their bitmask would have bits set for the corresponding indices of those skills in `req_skills`.

4. The function defines a helper function `backtrack(index, bitmask)` to perform the backtracking. `index` represents the index of the current person being considered, and `bitmask` represents the skills covered so far in the team.

5. In the `backtrack` function, it checks if the `bitmask` covers all required skills (i.e., `bitmask == target`). If yes, it means the team is sufficient, and it returns an empty list (indicating no more people are needed).

6. If the `index` reaches the end of the `people_bitmasks` list (i.e., all people have been checked), and the `bitmask` does not cover all required skills, it means there is no solution. In this case, the function returns `None`.

7. The function proceeds to explore two possibilities for the current person:

   a. Skip the current person (`team1`): In this case, it calls the `backtrack` function with the next person (i.e., `index + 1`) and the same `bitmask`. It will explore the solution space without including the current person.

   b. Include the current person (`team2`): In this case, it calls the `backtrack` function with the next person (i.e., `index + 1`) and the updated `bitmask` obtained by adding the current person's skills to the `bitmask`. It will explore the solution space with the current person in the team.

8. After exploring both possibilities, the function checks if a solution is found for either `team1` or `team2`. If no solution is found for one of them (i.e., `team1 is None` or `team2 is None`), it returns the other team. If both teams are found, it returns the team with the smaller size (fewer people).

9. Finally, the `backtrack` function is called with `index=0` and `bitmask=0` to start the backtracking process from the first person with an empty team. The function then returns the indices of the people forming the smallest sufficient team.

The function guarantees to find a sufficient team since it is stated in the problem that such a team exists. It efficiently explores all possible combinations of people to find the smallest team fulfilling all required skills.
